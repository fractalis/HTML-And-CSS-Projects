                <h3>Functional Programming: An Introduction</h3>
                <p>Functional Programming is a paradigm where programs are composed by constructing functions
                    together. Functional programming has its roots in lambda calculus and follows a declarative
                    programming style. It treats functions as first-class citizens, which means you can pass functions
                    into functions, return functions from functions, assigned to variables, and stored in data-types.
